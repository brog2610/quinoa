This directory contains Docker configuration required to automatically build
Docker images with all dependencies pre-installed used for automated builds,
testing, and release.

Note that not all prerequisites are included. Excluded are binary files, e.g.,
proprietary software, such as Intel's C++ and Fortran Compilers and the MKL
library. See the docker files for more details.
