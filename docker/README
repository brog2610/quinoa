This directory contains Docker configuration required to automatically build
Docker images with all dependencies pre-installed used for automated builds and
testing.

Note that not all prerequisites are included. Note included are binary files,
such as openmpi release tarballs, or proprietary software, such as Intel's C++
and Fortran Compilers and the MKL library. See the docker files for more
details.
