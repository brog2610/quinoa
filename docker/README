This directory contains Docker configuration required to automatically build
Docker images with all dependencies pre-installed used for automated builds and
testing.

Note that not all prerequisites are included. Excluded are binary files, such as
OpenMPI release tarballs, or proprietary software, such as Intel's C++ and
Fortran Compilers and the MKL library. See the docker files for more details.
