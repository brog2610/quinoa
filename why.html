This list comprises our core values. All are important. Remove one and the last point can no longer be satisfied, which is really the main reason why we are doing this.</p>

 <h2><a class="anchor" id="exascale"></a>
1. Designed for the exascale era</h2>
<p>Our target machines are the largest distributed clusters in the world with millions of compute cores. Due to unprecedented hardware complexity and features such as dynamic frequency scaling, we must assume inhomogeneous performance among the parts of the system that may dynamically change in time. Therefore, to efficiently use the resources, our programming paradigm must allow asynchronous parallel execution. This enables overlapping computation, communication, input, and output. Asynchronous programming constitutes a major paradigm shift compared to the more traditional bulk-synchronous approach widely applied using the message passing paradigm. We believe that the most economic utilization of future computer hardware can only be achieved with a paradigm shift from bulk-synchronous to fully asynchronous programming. For most computational codes this deeply affects the programming style as well as the optimal data layout and algorithm structure which therefore would require a complete rewrite.</p>
<p>Quinoa was started from scratch instead of modifying an existing code. The code is designed to be fully asynchronous and built on [Charm++](<a href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu">http://charm.cs.illinois.edu</a>). Charm++ consists of libraries and a runtime system. Instead of message passing, Charm++ is founded on the migratable-objects programming model and supported by an adaptive runtime system. In Charm++ data and work-units interact via asynchronous function calls enabling fully asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming can be used to specify task-parallelism as well as data parallelism in a single application. The interacting objects may reside on the same or on a networked compute node and may migrate from one to another during computation. Object migration is transparent to the application and carried out by the runtime system based on real-time load measurement, but if needed can be influenced by the application. We believe that only with a runtime system as flexible as provided by Charm++ can exascale hardware be most effectively utilized. Charm++ is mature, it has been actively developed since the 1990s, and is used by several large production codes. Read a one-page summary on the strengths of Charm++ at <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/why">http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/why</a>.</p>

 <h2><a class="anchor" id="correct"></a>
2. Verified and proven to be correct</h2>
<p>Nothing is more important than code that works as advertised with no surprises. We strive for writing testable code as well as writing tests that cover the code to the maximum degree possible. Code coverage is quantified. Untested code is assumed to be incorrect until proven otherwise. Only with extensive [positive and negative](<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html">http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html</a>) testing can developers and users be assured of correctness.</p>
<p>In Quinoa code correctness is verified and quantified using multiple levels of testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A random number generator test suite subjects generators to stringent statistical tests which enables quantitative ranking of all generators available with respect to their quality and computational cost</li>
<li>A unit test suite with [code coverage](../../unittest_coverage/index.html) analysis is used to test the smallest units of code</li>
<li>A regression test suite with code coverage analysis tests features larger than the smallest units, such as multiple algorithms coupled to solve a differential equation</li>
<li>A ([planned](<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl">http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl</a>)) [fuzz test](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing</a>) suite helps prepare against invalid, unexpected, or random inputs with code coverage analysis</li>
</ul>

 <h2><a class="anchor" id="optimized"></a>
3. Optimized for performance, power, and reliability</h2>
<p>Power consumption is a primary concern in the exascale era. Application performance must be measured within power constraints on increasingly complex and thus likely less reliable hardware. A computation must optimize and thus dynamically adapt to maximize performance constrained by power limits while being resilient against hardware failures. This requires revolutionary methods with a stronger-than-before integration among hardware features, system software, and the application.</p>
<p>Quinoa relies on the [Charm++] (<a href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu">http://charm.cs.illinois.edu</a>) runtime system. The central idea of Charm++ is to enable and facilitate _overdecomposition_: computation (data and work-units) is decomposed into a large number of logical units mapped to available processors. The number of logical units are usually larger than the available processors. Overdecomposition allows the runtime system to dynamically adapt the computational load monitoring load-imbalance due to software (e.g., particle clustering, adaptive refinement) as well as hardware (e.g., dynamic processor frequency scaling). The runtime system can also migrate data and work-units if it notices (via sensors, cache monitors, etc.) if a compute node is about to fail. If a node fails without a warning, the application can be restarted from a previously saved checkpoint. Since overdecomposition is done without direct reference to physical processors on which data and work-units reside, the application can be restarted using a number of processors different than that of the checkpoint was saved with. Resiliency is provided by the runtime system transparent to the application and can save millions of cycles since jobs have to be restarted less frequently due to hardware failure.</p>

 <h2><a class="anchor" id="outsource"></a>
4. Advanced computer science outsourced to experts</h2>
<p>Hardware complexity is increasing. Simultaneously satisfying all the different requirements enumerated here inevitably increases software complexity. Attempting to tackle every aspect by the application programmer, as is frequently done in a research context, does not scale as more features are added. The combination of increasing hardware and software complexity in the exascale era leads to an unprecedented degree of specialization among the software components as well as their developers. Consistent with "picking the
right tool for the right job", components of complex software must be outsourced to subject-matter experts.</p>
<p>Quinoa's goal is to provide simulation software for scientific and engineering purposes. This involves numerically solving the differential and integral equations of mathematical physics. Advanced computer science, such as dynamic load balancing, object migration, networking, parallel input and output, is outsourced to those who make a career out them. Quinoa uses a number of [third-party libraries](licenses.html) and application developers closely collaborate with the subject-matter experts.</p>

</div>
 <h2><a class="anchor" id="language"></a>
5. Using a language that can cope with complexity</h2>
<p>The ultimate measure of the value of a computer language is how it balances runtime performance and code complexity. A good language can do a lot for a designer and a programmer, as long as its strengths and limitations are clearly understood and respected.</p>
<p>Quinoa's main language of choice is C++ for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It offers [uncompromising performance](layout.html::layout_comparison)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is statically typed, resulting in earlier error detection, more reliable algorithms, and compiled code that executes quicker</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It supports [data abstraction](layout.html), enabling the representation of [non-trivial concepts](_diff_eq_2_diff_eq_8h_source.html)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It allows programming using more than one programming style, each to its best effect; as such it supports [procedural](_derived_data_8_c_source.html), [object oriented](_diff_eq_2_diff_eq_8h_source.html), [generic](_factory_8h_source.html) as well as [functional](_tagged_tuple_8h_source.html) programming</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It provides a portable [standard library](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Standard_Library">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Standard_Library</a>) with [guaranteed algorithmic complexity](<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/complexity.html">http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/complexity.html</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>C++, especially [modern C++](<a href="http://herbsutter.com/elements-of-modern-c-style/">http://herbsutter.com/elements-of-modern-c-style/</a>), provides the flexibility we need. We use the latest C++14 language standard with multiple compilers. This reduces code complexity and improves productivity as well as runtime performance.</p>
<div class="image">

</div>
 <h2><a class="anchor" id="productivity"></a>
6. Highly-valued programmer productivity</h2>
<p>Due to software complexity the most expensive resource in implementing and maintaining computing capability is the developer's time. In a successful project programmer productivity must be highly regarded and actively maintained. Besides comfortable work environment and an inspiring culture, this involves using the best and most versatile software engineering tools available. Only by using the latest and the greatest tools are code reuse, extensibility, maintainability, and thus productivity maximized.</p>
<p>Quinoa is developed using the latest compiler technology and software engineering tools. We believe developers must be skilled not only in their expertise, e.g., physics, differential equations, numerical methods, but in their tools of trade as well, e.g., the latest software development techniques.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="handshake.svg" alt="handshake.svg"/>
</div>
 <h2><a class="anchor" id="friendly"></a>
7. User and developer friendly</h2>
<p>User experience is [the most important design goal](<a href="http://resources.idgenterprise.com/original/AST-0053933_seven_qualities_of_wildly_desirable_software.pdf">http://resources.idgenterprise.com/original/AST-0053933_seven_qualities_of_wildly_desirable_software.pdf</a>) of desirable software. However, this does not require a graphical user interface. Also, expert developers should be able to get started quickly, extend the code in a productive manner, and tailor functionality to their or their customer's needs.</p>
<p>User input in Quinoa is restricted to command-line arguments and simple-to-read text files. The input grammar is versatile and extensible. Parsing is outsourced to a library written by experts in that field. Error messages are friendly and often suggest a solution. Documentation of command-line and input file keywords is directly accessible at the user's fingertips, obtained via command-line arguments. New keywords, reflecting new features, are made impossible to add without proper in-code documentation. Simulation result output is highly customizable.</p>

</div>
 <h2><a class="anchor" id="documented"></a>
8. Well documented</h2>
<p>Undocumented code is considered legacy code and a major impediment to progress and productivity.</p>
<p>Quinoa is well-documented for developers, users, administrators as well as auditors. This includes documentation for</p>
<ul>
<li>theory</li>
<li>software requirements, specification, design, implementation, and interfaces</li>
<li>verification and validation</li>
<li>user examples</li>
<li>source code control history</li>
<li>team collaboration documentation and history</li>
<li>code correctness and quality assurance</li>
<li>legal issues</li>
</ul>
<p>All documentation is accessible at a single point of entry via any web browser with no separate documents to open or print. The documentation is searchable, indexable, and looks great on any device, including [figures](walker_example_ou.html::walker_example_ou_pdf) and [math](_generalized_dirichlet_8h.html::details).</p>
<div class="image">

</div>
 <h2><a class="anchor" id="fun"></a>
9. Fun to work on</h2>
<p>We believe all the above are equally important in order to make this project fun to work on. None of the above can be an afterthought: they must all be simultaneously considered at all times and from the outset.</p>
