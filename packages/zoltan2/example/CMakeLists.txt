# For Tpetra_config.h to get explicit instantiation info
#
# FIXME (mfh 17 Dec 2014) Tpetra_config.h doesn't exist anymore.  I'll
# do my best by pointing to tpetra/core/src, where one could find the
# automatically generated header file TpetraCore_config.h.  However,
# the best policy is still to include Tpetra_ConfigDefs.hpp.
# Furthermore, if Zoltan2 depends on Tpetra, why does Zoltan2 need to
# add a Tpetra include directory explicitly to its list of include
# directories?
