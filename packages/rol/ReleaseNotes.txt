Rapid Optimization Library (ROL)

RELEASE TAG: Trilinos 12.2
------------
Released as part of Trilinos 12.2, July 2015.  This is the first publicly
announced release of ROL.


FEATURES:
---------

Rapid Optimization Library (ROL) is a C++ package for large-scale
optimization. It is used for the solution of optimal design, optimal control
and inverse problems in large-scale engineering applications. Other uses
include mesh optimization and image processing.

ROL aims to combine flexibility, efficiency and robustness.  Key features:

*** Matrix-free application programming interfaces (APIs) --enable direct use
    of application data structures and memory spaces, linear solvers,
    nonlinear solvers and preconditioners.
*** State-of-the-art algorithms for unconstrained optimization, constrained
    optimization and optimization under uncertainty --enable inexact and
    adaptive function evaluations and iterative linear system solves.
*** Special APIs for simulation-based optimization --enable a streamlined
    embedding into engineering applications, rigorous implementation
    verification and efficient use.
*** Modular interfaces throughout the optimization process --enable custom
    and user-defined algorithms, stopping criteria, hierarchies of algorithms,
    and selective use of a variety of tools and components.

For a detailed description of user interfaces and algorithms included in this
release, see the presentation ROL-Trilinos-12.2.pptx (or .pdf) in the
doc/presentations directory.


BUG FIXES:
----------
None (first release).
