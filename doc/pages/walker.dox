Walker is used to integrate a system of differential equations in time. The
system may contain multiple types of ordinary or stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). Walker allows the estimation of arbitrary coupled statistics
and probability density functions. Walker is intended as a general mathematical
tool to analyze the numerical behavior of SDEs and its statistics.

Walker uses the [Charm++](http://charm.cs.illinois.edu) runtime system to run
the integration concurrently, either on a single machine or a networked set of
computers.

As usual, use the \a -h command-line parameter to get on-screen help from an
executable. Example output, exluding Charm++ command-line parameters:
\code{.py}
$ walker -h
