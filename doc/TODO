* CONTROL HIERARCHY: Control::Bundle would be nicer with a hierarchical
  structure.

* ALTERNATIVE RND LIBRARY: Need a quick switchable way of building without MKL
  as it is practically impossible to distinguish between memory leaks (hopefully
  false positives) in MKL and non-MKL code. May need to implement another random
  number library.

* TESTING: Don't know how long I can keep going without some sort of unit and/or
  regression testing infrastructure.
