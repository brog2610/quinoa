* Control::Bundle would be nicer with a hierarchical structure.

* Need a quick switchable way of building without MKL as it is practically
  impossible to distinguish between memory leaks in MKL and non-MKL code. May
  need to implement another random number library.

* Don't know how long I can keep going without some sort of unit and/or
  regression testing infrastructure.
