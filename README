How to build

1. Pick compilers

    $ CC=mpicc CXX=mpic++ FC=mpif90 F77=mpif77 F90=mpif90

2. Build third-party libraries (TPLs) in empty build directory

    $ cmake <path-to-tpl-dir>
    $ make

The CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX cmake variable defaults to <path-to-tpl-dir>/install/<compiler>, which is where the TPLs are installed.

3. Build Quinoa in empty build directory

    $ cmake <path-to-src-dir>
    $ make

All executables will be in <build>/Main.
The TPL_DIR cmake variable defaults to <path-to-tpl-dir>/install/<compiler>.

4. Build the documentation in the build directory

    $ make doc

Point a web browser to <build>/doc/html/index.html.

5. Build code coverage report in the build directory

    $ make coverage

Point a web browser to <build>/unittest_coverage/index.html.
