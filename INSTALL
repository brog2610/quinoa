============
Installation
============

The most common installation procedure on Unix-like systems looks as
follows.

Unpack the tar archive and change into the unpacked directory.

  ./configure
  make check install


=======================
Intel compiler settings
=======================

The Intel compiler can improve performance by vectorizing certain
parts of the code on x86 architectures. Assuming your CPU supports
AVX2, the following options will increase encoding speed.

  ./configure CC=icc
  make CFLAGS="-O3 -xCORE-AVX2" bench

On a 3.4 GHz E3-1240 v3 we see more than 400 MiB/s for encoding
typical data.

Using other SIMD instruction sets on older CPUs may also help.

=======
Windows
=======

As an alternative way to build libaec you can use CMake. CMake can
also generate project files for Microsoft Visual Studio. This allows
you to build AEC.DLL and SZIP.DLL which can be used with the Windows
version of HDF5.
